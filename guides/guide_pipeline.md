# Data pipeline guide

A sysadmin guide for setting up the Bohemia data "pipeline"

## Standards and "rules"  

The data processing scripts that migrate data from the ODK Aggregate server to project databases require that: 

1. All `.xml` forms deployed on the ODK Aggregate server be generated via the `xls2xform` functionality (or via the python scripts for conversion in the `scripts` sub-directory), _not_ via online converters.

2. All repeat elements (ie, xlsform rows in which the type is `begin repeat`) must contain `repeat_` prefix in the `name` field.

3. No non-repeat elements should contain the word `repeat` in the name field.

4. All group elements (ie, xlsform rows in which the type is `begin group`) must contain `group_` prefix in the `name` field.

5. No non-group elements should contain the word `group` in the name field.

6. All note elements (ie, xlsform rows in which the type is `note`) must contain `note_` prefix in the `name` field.

7. No non-note elements should contain the word `note` in the name field.


## General overview

First, the ODK utilities in the `bohemia` R package (main wrapper function: `odk_get_data`) are used for fetching data from ODK Aggregate databases. Second, cleaning/formatting functions in the `bohemia` R package are used to process the data so as to conform with database standards. Third, the script in `scripts/bohemia_db_schema.sql` is used to set up the PosgreSQL database. Finally, upload functions in the `bohemia` R package are used to send data to the database. 

The above is all run automatically every N minutes via crontab which executes the script at `scripts/run_odk_get_data_cron.sh`.

## Database set up

### Deploy  

- Go to the Amazon RDS page: https://eu-west-3.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=eu-west-3#  
- Click "Create database"  
- Select "Amazon Aurora" and ensure the edition is "with PostgreSQL compatibility"  
- Set version to 11.6  
- Select "Production" under "Templates"  
- For DB cluster identifier, type "bohemiacluster"  
- For master username, use the master username in the credentials file: `psql_master_username`
- For master password, use the master password in the credentials file: `psql_master_password`
- Set "DB instance size" to "Memory optimized" and leave the instance type as is (2 cpus, 16 g ram)  
- For availability and durability, select yes for creating a different node in a different zone  
- Use default VPC  
- Click additional connectivity configuration  
- Under "Public access", click "yes"  
- For VPC security group, click "Create new" and call it "bohemiadbgroup"  
- Keep database port as 5432  
- For database authentication, select "Password and IAM database authentication"  
- Under additional configuration:
  - Intitial database name: `bohemia`  
- You'll now see the `bohemiacluster` database set up at `endpoint` (in the credentials file)
- In the browswer, go to https://eu-west-3.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-3#SecurityGroups and modify inbound and outbound rules to accept all traffic.  

- You can connect to the db like this:  
```
psql \
   --host=<ENDPOINT> \
   --port=5432 \
   --username=<psql_master_username>\
   --password
```
- A password will be prompted  


### Populate

- Connect to the db (see above)  
- Run the following:  
```
CREATE DATABASE bohemia;
``` 
- Now disconnect and re-connect to the database as per below:

```
psql \
   --host=<ENDPOINT> \
   --port=5432 \
   --username=<psql_master_username>\
   --password\
   --dbname=bohemia
```

- Copy paste the code from `scripts/bohemia_db_schema.sql`  
- Now, you can access the database via R using the following:  

```
library(bohemia)
library(yaml)
creds_fpath <- '/home/ubuntu/Documents/bohemia/credentials/credentials.yaml'  # Change this to your local path
creds <- yaml::yaml.load_file(creds_fpath)
url <- 'https://bohemia.systems'
id = 'minicensus'
id2 = NULL
user = creds$databrew_odk_user
password = creds$databrew_odk_pass
psql_end_point = creds$endpoint
psql_user = creds$psql_master_username
psql_pass = creds$psql_master_password

require('RPostgreSQL')
drv <- dbDriver('PostgreSQL')
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname='bohemia', host=psql_end_point, 
                 port=5432,
                 user=psql_user, password=psql_pass)
```

- Having retrieved the data, the code for updating it is in `scripts/update_database.R`.  


## Data Update

As mentioned in the General Overview section, the `bohemia` R package (main wrapper function: `odk_get_data`) used for fetching data from ODK is run every N minutes automatically. This section details the steps to deploy and set it up on AWS EC2 instances.

### CronTab Set Up
1. SSH into the server e.g:

   ```ssh ubuntu@ec2-18-218-151-100.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com```

2. As `sudo` run (on the shell):

   `crontab -e`

   a. In the crontab editor opened, type in for an automatic run every 15 minutes: 
   
      ```15 * * * * sh /home/ubuntu/Documents/bohemia/scripts/run_odk_get_data_cron.sh```
   
   b. Save and exit the editor.

3. Wait for the time set to verify the job is run by checking the console output for the echo statements.

### Deploy
The script is part of the main project and should be deployed with it.

The script depends upon `Rscript` and so this should be installed if it doesn't already exist on the server by running:
   
   `sudo apt update && apt install Rscript`
